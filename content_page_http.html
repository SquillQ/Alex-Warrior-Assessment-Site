                <p> <b>1. What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):</b> HTTP is a protocol that allows the fetching of resources such as HTML documents. </p>
                <p> <b>2. Why is HTTP called a <i> stateless protocol?</i> :</b> It is refered to as a 'stateless protocol' as there is no link between two requests being successively carried out on the same connection. </p>
                <p> <b>3. Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP:</b> Firstly, the client establishes a TCP connection. Secondly, the client sends its request and waits for an answer. Finally, the server process the request, sends back its answe and provides a status code and the appropriate data.</p>
                <p> <b>4. Describe the parameters on a get and post request:</b> On a 'get' request, the browser takes in the requested resource as a parameter. On a 'post' request, the browser takes in the data provided and sends it to the server for a response.</p>
                <p> <b>5. What are the HTTP response status code and what do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate? :</b> HTTP response codes indicate wether a requeset has been completed succeffully or not. The code 200 indicates that the request has been succeeded. Code 404 means the server can not find the requested resource.</p>
                <p> <b>6. What are HTTP cookies? Give an example: An HTTP cookie is a piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. Cookies can be used to ensure that a user stays logged in accross web pages for example. </b></p>
                <p> <b>7. Why are cookies a security issue? :</b> Cookies are liable to threats as it is data being sent between a server and client that can be intercepted e.g. login authentication. They are also a privicy concern as a webpage may be using cookies to log information about the client accross differnet webpages and start to build up a profile of browsing history or habits.</p>
                <p> <b>8. Describe session hijacking and XSS:</b> Session hijacking in the process of gaining access to and misusing a user's authenticated session. This may happen by stealing a cookie for an existing session or by fooling the user into setting a cookie with a predetermined session ID. XSS or cross-site scripting is a security explout in which an attacker injects malicious client-side code into website. The victim executes code and allows the attacks to bypass access controls and impersonate users.</p>
                <p> <b>9. Describe Cross-site request forgery (CSRF):</b>CSRF is an attack that impersonates a trusted user and sends a website unwanted commands. This can be accomplished by including malicious parameters in a URL behind a link that appears to be legitimate.</p>
                <p> <b>10. What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS? :</b> CORS is a mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other domains, schemes, or ports in which a browser should permit loading of resources. An example of requests that use CORS is web fonts. CORS allows a browser to make requests to a server holding a font to be used on that webpage.</p>
